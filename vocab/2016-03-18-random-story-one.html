<hr />

<p>To work in RandomX is a luminous career for anyone. After perennial trials, I finally managed to get an offer from them. After the offer I had a meeting
with my manager in RandomX. 
Initially in the meeting, manager appeared very frank and gregarious. I felt that manager will condone my frowning on the number of working hours.
But this contention because of working hours caused the company to rescind the job offer.
I was not able to exculpate myself from the accusations of the manager.</p>

<p>The manager turned out to be the most obdurate person I have met in my life. I refrained myself from spewing invective to this manager and RandomX for 
having such hires. This entire episode left an antipathy for RandomX in my heart.</p>

<p>On knowing all this, one of my friend studying disease pathology, told me that it could me a pathological problem with the manager to not accept any disagreement.
On listening to my friend, I realised that may be if I worked with the manager, my job might have turned into a bondage.</p>

<p>I seldom liked fawning over the boss. Thus this rescinding of the offer actually turned out to be a good thing. After realising all this, I moved
on with alacrity.</p>
