<h3> The importance of book selection </h3>

<p>My habit of spending significant time on prudent selection of books dates back to my college days. I still have vivid memories of times when I 
used to treat myself with a splurge of these books every summer.</p>

<p>Reading from classical texts has always been a prolific experience. They help in unequivocal grasp of the material while evading misconceptions. Their content 
 have always engrossed me in the beauty of the subject.</p>

<p>(Un)Fortunately I have a few hideous experiences from books which have gone too far to make the content easy and appealing by undermining the actual 
beauty of the subject. Some times reading from these books also may lead to misapprehension and equivocal understanding.</p>

<p>Its a daunting task for authors to present difficult concepts in easy way without deteriorating the quality. While there are authors who are incredibly 
good in this art but most of them fail miserably and produce detestable results.</p>

<p>Also there is another breed of frenzied authors coming up with new editions of same books every year with no significant changes in the content for 
increasing sales while deprecating the quality.</p>

<p>I have seen people(including myself) defending their misconceptions when challenged. They go through the following stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>defending themselves for being correct</li>
  <li>realisation of being incorrect</li>
  <li>unlearning misconceptions</li>
  <li>learning from right sources</li>
</ul>

<p>Another thing that irates me of these texts is the contagious misconceptions it results when one move towards higher concepts based 
on his inaccurate or limited understanding from these texts.</p>

<p>The most abominable thing for the readers, especially incredulous, is they may continue to live in oblivion forever!</p>

<p>Thus the pedagogical way of giving priority to the ease of reading at the cost of compromise in quality is inexplicable and disastrous.</p>

<p>A few of my amicable colleagues tried to convey through innuendo for me being too choosy for the books. These books are my guides, my torchbearers,
and I keep revisiting them based on my needs. Also they serve as souvenirs of the days when I first wandered in those lands.</p>

<p>I hope this explains why prudent selection of the books matters.</p>

<p>Incredulous is the opposite of credulous, which means “believing too easily.” Both words come from the Latin word credere, which means “to believe.” Incredulous 
is stronger than skeptical; if you’re incredulous of something, you refuse to believe it, but if you’re skeptical, you’re doubtful but you haven’t ruled it out completely.</p>

<p>Incredible describes something you can’t believe because it’s so right, like an incredible double rainbow. Incredulous describes how you feel when you can’t believe 
something because it’s so wrong, like when someone tells you leprechauns left two pots of gold.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>“a token” of an event or experience.</p>

<p>something of sentimental value</p>

<p>a reminder of past events</p>

<p>A song by Tears for Fears goes, “Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.” Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but 
more often it refers to something tangible, like a memento, gift, or trophy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>His most significant <strong>souvenir</strong> from the ordeal was a loss of vision on his right side.</li>

<p>characterized by friendliness and absence of discord(disagreement).</p>

<p>showing a polite and friendly desire to avoid disagreement and argument.</p>

<p>The adjective amicable means “friendly” — but in particular, use it when describing relations one might otherwise expect to be unfriendly. The end of a 
romantic relationship that’s less than amicable might involve broken dishes or broken bones.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>If you were a bit more <strong>amicable</strong>, people would not be afraid to approach you.</li>
      <li>Because Leslie is very <strong>amicable</strong>, she is the peacemaker in her family.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, the insurance company and the driver can reach an <strong>amicable</strong> agreement regarding the property value.</li>
      <li>The bill collector did not have an <strong>amicable</strong> attitude when he called my home.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="evade"> Evade </h4>

<p>avoid or try to avoid fulfilling, answering, or performing (duties, questions, or issues)</p>

<p>When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your mother’s questions about the missing cookies by slipping into another topic.</p>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Melissa believes she is entitled and can <strong>evade</strong> any law because she is related to the town mayor.</li>
      <li>People tend to <strong>evade</strong> direct eye contact when they are lying.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="hideous"> Hideous </h4>

<p>horrible or frightful to the senses; repulsive; very ugly. eg: a hideous monster.</p>

<p>grossly offensive to decency or morality; causing horror. eg: “a hideous pattern of injustice”</p>

<p>so extremely ugly as to be terrifying. eg: “a hideous scar”</p>

<p>Hideous is a word that means extremely ugly. Anything or anybody that is painful — and a little scary — to look at is hideous.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The con man flashed a <strong>hideous</strong> smile, giving us the chills.</li>
      <li>The scary creature made <strong>hideous</strong> croaking sounds, terrifying us all.</li>
      <li>Frank was hit in a <strong>hideous</strong> accident, requiring multiple operations.</li>

      <li><strong>Hideous</strong> though it was, the scar emphasized her strength.</li>
      <li>A terrible sense of fear filled her, and she heard a noise, a <strong>hideous</strong> crunching noise, accompanied by blinding pain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="engross"> Engross </h4>

<p>devote (oneself) fully to.</p>

<p>consume all of one’s attention or time.</p>

<p>Engross is a verb that means to consume all of your attention or time. Once you engross yourself in the culture of high salaries and unlimited spending accounts, it’s hard to go back to cooking at a sandwich shop.</p>

<p>Immersing yourself fully in something can be good or bad. If you’re studying Shakespeare, you want the plays to engross you so you don’t lose focus. But if your video games engross you so much that you forget to shower or eat, that’s a problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The critic gave the movie a poor review because it failed to <strong>engross</strong> his concentration.</li>
      <li>Because I typically hate science fiction movies, I do not expect this Mars’ thriller to <strong>engross</strong> me.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="pedagogical"> Pedagogical </h4>

<p>of or relating to pedagogy.</p>

<p>pedagogy means activities of educating, teaching or instructing.</p>

<p>If your teacher has pedagogical dreams all night long, even in sleep, his mind is in the classroom.</p>

<p>If it’s pedagogical, it concerns teaching, from lesson plans to approaches to teaching, even how the classroom looks — in rooms where the teacher’s pedagogical 
philosophy is that students learn better when they work collaboratively, desks may be pushed together so four students can sit in their groups.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Mrs. Brown follows a unique style of <strong>pedagogy</strong>, and she often allows her students to take over the lesson.</li>
      <li>While the basic principles of <strong>pedagogy</strong> are designed to provide learners with the best education, they are completely ineffective if students do not have the desire to learn.</li>
      <li>Even though this <strong>pedagogy</strong> proved effective in the past, it is inadequate in today’s schools because it hasn’t kept up with continuing technological developments.</li>
      <li>US representatives are looking into the <strong>pedagogy</strong> used in other countries to try to determine why American students are behind in science and math skills.</li>
      <li>This <strong>pedagogical</strong> approach is not likely to hold up in court.</li>
      <li>Direct instruction is a highly effective <strong>pedagogical</strong> technique, and there’s good evidence to suggest it can help close achievement gaps.</li>
      <li>To facilitate change, we outline here rigorous examples of best-in-class <strong>pedagogical</strong> practices, programmes and policies.</li>
      <li>Many believe adaptive learning technologies will pave the way for a <strong>pedagogical</strong> renaissance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="innuendo"> Innuendo </h4>

<p>an indirect (and usually malicious) implication.</p>

<p>Speaking in innuendo is when you say something indirectly — often of a hurtful or sexual nature.</p>

<p>a statement that indirectly suggests someone has done something immoral, improper, etc.</p>

<ul>

<h4 word="" id="equivocal"> equivocal </h4>

<p>Try to remember that uncertain means equivocal and certain means unequivocal. That’s a tricky movement the un- is making, and a lot of people get stumped.</p>

    </ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="unequivocally"> unequivocally </h4>

<p>not equivocally.</p>

<p>unquestionably clear</p>

<h4 word="" id="detestable"> detestable </h4>

<h4 word="" id="abominable"> Abominable </h4>

<p>unequivocally detestable. eg: abominable treatment of prisoners.</p>

<p>exceptionally bad or displeasing. eg: abominable workmanship.</p>

<p>Abominable is as bad as it gets.</p>

<p>Abominable is an adjective that should be used only when something is exceptionally bad or threatening, like a gigantic furry snowman who is terrorizing 
a village. Abominable is so absolutely awful that it causes physical revulsion. So odious that it brings even the toughest of tough guys to tears. Which 
is a bummer, because it’s a surprisingly fun word to say out loud.</p>
