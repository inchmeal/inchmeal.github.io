<h4 word="" id="duress"> Duress </h4>

<p>threats, violence, constraints, or other action used to coerce someone into doing something against their will or better judgement.</p>

<p>Let’s hope you’re never denied food and sleep and forced to sign a confession, but if you are, that’s called being under <strong>duress</strong>. Threats 
and harsh treatment meant to make you do something you don’t want to do is <strong>duress</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The judge overturned the case because the defendant’s attorney proved that his client’s confession had been given under <strong>duress</strong>.</li>
      <li>Gold performs well during periods of extreme <strong>duress</strong>.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="quip"> Quip </h4>

<p>a witty remark.</p>

<p>A <strong>quip</strong> — a short, witty comment — can be pleasant, wise, or sarcastic, but usually carries an element of humor.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>“It was the only surprise my family has ever successfully kept,” Naomi <strong>quips</strong>.</li>
      <li>“It was a rookie mistake and I’m no rookie, so I should be shot for that one,” he <strong>quipped</strong>.</li>
      <li>The <strong>quip</strong> broke the ice and The Beatles relaxed into comedy mode.</li>
      <li>It may be an old <strong>quip</strong>, but it’s true: “Good decisions come from experience, and experience comes from bad decisions.”</li>
      <li>The <strong>quip</strong> did not go down well with Democrats.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="crouch"> Crouch </h4>

<p>To press the entire body close to the ground with the limbs bent.</p>

<p>To bend (the head or knee, for example) low, as in fear or humility.</p>

<p>To <strong>crouch</strong> is to bend your knees, pull your body in, and sit on your heels. This position is called a <strong>crouch</strong>. You might <strong>crouch</strong> down to 
pet a kitten or catch a baseball.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>“I’m okay, Mama,” I said as I <strong>crouched</strong> in a corner.</li>

      <li>I sink into a <strong>crouch</strong> and crawl toward one of the trees so that the trunk will hide me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="cower"> Cower </h4>

<p>crouch down in fear.</p>

<p>When you <strong>cower</strong>, you’re not just afraid. You’re so terrified that your whole body cringes, crouches, and shrinks in on itself to hide from the source of your fear.</p>

<p>Although a coward might <strong>cower</strong> in fear, the two words aren’t related.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The dog was <strong>cowering</strong> in silence in a corner.</li>
      <li>Soldiers in stained red uniforms <strong>cower</strong> in each of them, like blood filling a wound.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="vivacious"> Vivacious </h4>

<p>full of high spirits and animation; lively or vital</p>

<p>Some people are just naturally fun to be around; they sparkle, they animate any group they’re part of, they’re full of life. That, in fact, 
is the root meaning of the word: it’s from Latin vivere “to live.” It has more of a sense of playfulness than lively or animated. 
Even the most sedentary slob can feel revitalized in the presence of a <strong>vivacious</strong> soul.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>She was a very <strong>vivacious</strong> young lady who loved life, which is so ironic since it ended so quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Vivacious</strong>. Happy. Beautiful, in and out. She had a strong faith in God.</li>
      <li>He spoke very quickly, had a <strong>vivacious</strong> blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures.</li>

      <li>I distinctly remember the <strong>vivacious</strong> optimism that inundated the United States when the Soviet Union imploded in the early 1990s.</li>
      <li>Tolkien describes her in a <strong>vivacious</strong> romantic way which overwhelmed me, honestly.</li>
      <li>He had the youthful and <strong>vivacious</strong> face of a man in the thirties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="instigate"> Instigate </h4>

<p>bring about or initiate (an action or event).</p>

<p>incite someone to do something, especially something bad.</p>

<p>When you <strong>instigate</strong> something, you start it, but the word carries conflict with it. For eg:
If you <strong>instigate</strong> a food fight in the cafeteria, you might throw the first spoonful of mashed potatoes, but then you stop and let all 
the other students carry on the chaos. When something is instigated, the outcome tends to be unknown. The plan you <strong>instigate</strong> might not 
lead to the desired result.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The road construction will definitely <strong>instigate</strong> major traffic delays during rush hour.</li>
      <li>Cigarette smoke can easily <strong>instigate</strong> an asthma attack in a person who has a weak respiratory system.</li>
      <li>Because poor people often cannot afford things they need, poverty is a factor that is known to <strong>instigate</strong> crime.</li>

      <li>She is facing charges of <strong>instigating</strong> violence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="ecstatic"> Ecstatic </h4>

<p>feeling or expressing overwhelming happiness or joyful excitement.</p>

<p>involving an experience of mystic self-transcendence.</p>

<p>The adjective <strong>ecstatic</strong> turns the noun “ecstasy” into a descriptive word.</p>

<p>Originally, <strong>ecstatic</strong> had religious connotations having to do with the sheer joy of knowing God or someone truly holy. That meaning remains today, but <strong>ecstatic</strong> 
now includes almost anything that’s really pleasurable or wonderful. I was <strong>ecstatic</strong> at the news that I’d been nominated for an award. The entire world reacted 
with an <strong>ecstatic</strong> sense of glee when the Berlin Wall finally came down. The hangover the next day, though, wasn’t so ecstatic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Ann was <strong>ecstatic</strong> when Henry finally proposed.</li>
      <li>When a snow day was announced, the students were <strong>ecstatic</strong> to miss a day of school.</li>
      <li>As soon as the parade started, <strong>ecstatic</strong> children began to yell.</li>
      <li>It is hard to be <strong>ecstatic</strong> when you are stranded on the side of the highway.</li>
      <li>She just offered to be my adviser, and I was obviously <strong>ecstatic</strong> and said yes.</li>
      <li>It garnered universally <strong>ecstatic</strong> reviews and also appreciative tears from front-row attendees.</li>
      <li>Certainly, I had no <strong>ecstatic</strong> experience, except a flattening out of appetite.</li>
      <li>Then, after a few minutes of <strong>ecstatic</strong> joy, it sinks in: You are an intern.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="reminiscent"> Reminiscent </h4>

<p>tending to remind one of something.</p>

<p>suggesting something by resemblance.</p>

<p>Reminiscent can have a good or bad implication. If you tell someone that her paintings are <strong>reminiscent</strong> of a chimp’s finger paintings, obviously
 that’s not so good. But if you tell her that they’re <strong>reminiscent</strong> of Dali, well that might be better.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>The sights were <strong>reminiscent</strong> of my childhood.</li>
      <li>Her robes were vaguely <strong>reminiscent</strong> of military dress.</li>
      <li>The smells coming from the bakery were <strong>reminiscent</strong> of the scents that used to come from my grandmother’s kitchen.</li>
      <li>The singer’s smooth singing style is very <strong>reminiscent</strong> of the crooners of the 1920s and 1930s.</li>
      <li>In the photograph, it is obvious the toddler is very <strong>reminiscent</strong> of her mother at that age.</li>
      <li>The letter accused censors of using tactics <strong>reminiscent</strong> of Maoist times to silence and smear critics.</li>
      <li>For some people here, that’s uncomfortably <strong>reminiscent</strong> of 1970s Maoism.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, the behavior could be more symbolic—and more <strong>reminiscent</strong> of our own past.</li>
      <li>Physicists are using a technique <strong>reminiscent</strong> of a classic video game to observe DNA on the nanoscale.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="appall"> Appall </h4>

<p>greatly dismay or horrify.</p>

<p>feeling shocked and disappointed.</p>

<p>fill with apprehension or alarm; cause to be unpleasantly surprised</p>

<p>The word appall always carries with it the feeling of disgust. You might be shocked by a loud noise, but in order for it to <strong>appall</strong> you, 
it would probably have to come along with a really foul smell or a gruesome scene.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Virginia was <strong>appalled</strong> when she learned her thirteen-year-old daughter was pregnant.</li>
      <li>“We’re <strong>appalled</strong> and genuinely sorry that this happened,” a Google representative said.</li>
      <li>It is <strong>appalling</strong> and utterly disgraceful that anyone would carry out such an attack in God’s name.</li>

      <li>The religious teen was <strong>appalled</strong> when she opened a profanity-filled email.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="moot"> Moot </h4>

<p>(adj)subject to debate, dispute, or uncertainty.</p>

<p>(adj)having little or no practical relevance.</p>

<p>(verb)raise (a question or topic) for discussion; suggest (an idea or possibility).</p>

<p>(noun)a hypothetical case that law students argue as an exercise</p>

<p>Though <strong>moot</strong> can mean to debate endlessly without any clear decision or to think about something carefully, it most often describes ideas and 
arguments that don’t really matter. When someone accuses you of making a <strong>moot</strong> point, he’s basically saying, 
“Come on! Let’s talk about what’s important.”</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>If Uber buys a fleet of cars, its claims of being a technology company rather than a transportation company would become <strong>moot</strong>.</li>
      <li>This debate is largely <strong>moot</strong>.</li>
      <li>Because your facts come from an unverified source, your research paper is <strong>moot</strong>.</li>

      <li>Tony is <strong>mooting</strong> a cap on total personal income from all sources.</li>
      <li>Likewise, in 2014 he alienated partners by ignoring diplomatic advice and <strong>mooting</strong> a cap on the number of migrants from the EU to Britain.</li>
      <li>So now scholars are <strong>mooting</strong> the concept of “Corrective Progressivity.”</li>
      <li>A canal has been <strong>mooted</strong> for more than 300 years, but remains unbuilt because of the prohibitive difficulty and expense.</li>
      <li>The term ‘zero tolerance’ has now been <strong>mooted</strong> but I am not sure what that means.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="ruminate"> Ruminate </h4>

<p>think deeply about something.</p>

<p>chew the cud.</p>

<p>When you <strong>ruminate</strong>, it means you are thinking very deeply about something. You’re likely to be so lost in thought that you stare off into space and don’t hear people when they call your name.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Before I make any major decisions, I need to <strong>ruminate</strong> on all the facts.</li>
      <li>Cows emit more methane when they are <strong>ruminating</strong>.</li>
      <li>Philosophy and art majors may be interested in the press material, which <strong>ruminates</strong> on themes of human nature, infinity, and continuum.</li>
      <li>Before going to bed, people who can’t sleep worry a lot, and they start <strong>ruminating</strong> about not being able to sleep.</li>
      <li><strong>Ruminating</strong> on bad experiences could send people into a downwards spiral.</li>
      <li>But as I <strong>ruminated</strong> over what to make for the holiday meal this fall, another thought occurred to me.</li>
      <li>I now had time to <strong>ruminate</strong> on my situation.</li>
      <li><strong>Ruminations</strong> of a programmer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 word="" id="imperceptibly"> imperceptibly </h4>

<p>in an imperceptible manner or to an imperceptible degree.</p>

<p>The word <strong>imperceptibly</strong> is used for things that are hardly happening at all or happening to such a small degree that you barely notice.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Usages</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>It will happen so suddenly and <strong>imperceptibly</strong> you may not even know what has just transpired.</li>
      <li>Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost <strong>imperceptibly</strong>, and the boy felt better.</li>
      <li>Often the songs blend into each other <strong>imperceptibly</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>‘to alleviate’ is to make something easier to endure (e.g. alleviate the pain following surgery)</p>

<p>‘to mitigate’ ( Latin =’soften’ ) means to lessen in force or intensity 
When someone is found guilty of a crime, there may be ‘mitigating circumstances’. This means that there were circumstances surrounding the actual committing of the crime which are taken into account and so ‘soften’ the harshness of the penalty, reduce the sentence e.g. I kill a man. But the court is told he had just killed my chld. As far as the law is concerned, I had no right to take the law into my own hands and retaliate. I am guilty of homicide. But as opposed to being a cold-blooded murderer, the intensity of anger towards the man for what he had done is a mitigating factor when deciding the punishment to be handed out by the court.</p>
