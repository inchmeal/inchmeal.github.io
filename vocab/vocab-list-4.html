<h3> Martijn and Prof. Brian </h3>

<p>It was already past four O’clock when Martijn went to sleep after completing an assignment.</p>

<p>He woke up just after three hours of sleep to reach college in time. On the way Martijn realised that he forgot to carry the assignment in haste. He was 
 feeling too lethargic to go back for collecting the assignment. This made him apprehensive because it will give another opportunity to Prof. Brian for
castigating him.</p>

<p>Prof. Brian always enters the classroom with a scowl on his face and begins his lecture with a pompous bragging about his research and publications. The hapless 
student have no choice but to listen while the Professor pontificates about his subject. The Prof. always tries to persuade the students to assist him in his 
research. The Prof. was also known for the nefarious ways to take most credit for the work done by students who assist him in the research.</p>

<p>Martijn is already groping for ways to get the permission for submitting assignment next day. When his turn came, he languidly reached to the
Prof. and tried to explain how he forgot to bring the assignment. Professor following his usual dogmatic pedagogy yelled at Martijn to either complete another 
daunting assignment or face the consequences.</p>

<p>Disappointed with the turn of events, Martijn reached home. While working on a problem of the additional assignment, he stumbled on an ingenious idea which can be
applied in many areas and not just the problem in hand. After finishing the assignment, he engrossed himself in refining the idea.</p>

<p>He was contemplating to take Prof. help or submit this idea as independent research. With the help of Prof. it will be easy to verify the veracity of the idea
but it may end up in Prof. Brian taking most of the credit.</p>

<p>He decided to took help from another Professor, Prof. Sai and explained him this impeccable idea. It took some time for Prof. Sai to assimilate the beauty of the 
idea and soon he gladly accepted to help Martijn to publish his research. Prof. Sai and Martijn worked together to further refine this idea so that to make it 
clear and cogent.</p>

<p>Soon this news reached Prof. Brian and he was taken aback by the audacity of Martijn to take help from Prof. Sai. He got his hands over this research and the snob 
in him convinced that this research is not significant compared to his own work.</p>

<p>The day came when Martijn has to defend his thesis. He presented his work to the entire panel of Prof. in the most cogent way. Prof. Brian fired a volley of questions 
with the hope of devaluing Martijn’s work while emphasizing on his own work. Martijn’s patiently answered all the question and defended his research successfully. 
His explanations easily convinced the entire panel and everyone congratulated him for his work.</p>

<p>Needless to say, that this entire episode has made Prof. Brian popular for being an insecure narcissist.</p>

<p>If you’re asked a question and you grope for an answer, you’re at a loss for words. You can also grope another person, although I wouldn’t recommend it: grope is usually used to describe touching that is unwanted (i.e. creepy behavior).

<p>a condition of urgency making it necessary to hurry</p>

<p>the act of moving hurriedly and in a careless manner</p>
