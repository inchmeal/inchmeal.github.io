A confidence interval is a *random interval*. Or a confidence interval is a function and its gives different output based on the value taken by the random variable $$\, \bar X \,$$. When we say 95% confidence interval - it means that 95% of the intervals generated in this way will contain the population mean $$\, \mu \,$$.

**(a)** True. The confidence interval is formed using random variable $$\, \bar X \,$$ as it's center, thus the center is a random variable.

**(b)** True. This is as per the definition. 

**(c)** False. 

**(d)** False. To form 100 confidence intervals, it means either we will need a different random variable $$\, \bar X \,$$ or we will need different population parameter instead of $$\, \mu \,$$. But the confidence interval talks about a particular parameter and a particular random variable used for estimating that parameter. Also, note that it might be the case that when in the problem, **a** *confidence interval* is mentioned - it means a particular interval instead of random interval. In this case also the answer is false because it might be the case that all the 100 intervals formed might belong to the 5% set of the intervals that do not contain population mean. On average the answer is true but it is not true for every set of 100 intervals.
