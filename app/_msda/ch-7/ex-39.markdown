The probability of choosing atleast one defected item in the sample, $$\, p \,$$ = 1 - Probability of choosing no defected item in the sample.

We have total $$\, N \,$$ items and $$\, k \,$$ of them are defected. Thus the probability of choosing a sample of size $$\, n \,$$ with no defected item = $$\, \frac { {N-k} \choose n} {N \choose n} \,$$.

Thus $$\, p = 1 - \frac { {N-k} \choose n} {N \choose n} \,$$. Now we can plot this function with $$\, n \,$$ and $$\, p \,$$ as variables to get the desired sample size. Skipping the sketch part :)
