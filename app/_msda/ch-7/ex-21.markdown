To reduce the width of interval $$\, \bar X \pm 1.96\sigma_{\bar X} \,$$ by half, we need to reduce the variance, $$\, \sigma_{\bar X} \,$$ by half. Since $$\, \sigma_{\bar X}=\frac {\sigma} {\sqrt n} \,$$, it follows that we need to increase $$\, \sqrt n \,$$ by two times which in turn means that we need to increase $$\, n \,$$ or the sample the size by four times.
