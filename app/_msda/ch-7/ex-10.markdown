False. The histogram of the values of the sample will be similar to the histogram of the actual population and it will be reach more closer to the population when the sample size increases.
 
The histogram drawn for the sample mean of the various samples of a given size taken from the population will be approximately normal. This is clearly different from the histogram mentioned in the problem.
