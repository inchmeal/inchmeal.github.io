Denoting the random variables from the two surveys as $$\, X \,$$ and $$\, Y \,$$. Also denoting the the confidence intervals by $$\, C_{X} \,$$ and $$\, C_{Y} \,$$ respectively. Denoting the probability that the condidence interval contains the respective population mean by $$\, P_X \,$$ and $$\, P_Y \,$$.

Since the surveys are independent, it means that the random variables, say $$\, X \text{ and } Y \,$$ will also be independent. Thus condidence intervals are also independent. It follows that the probability of both of them containing the respective population mean:

$$ P_X \times P_Y = \, 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81 \,$$.

And the probability that both of them do not contain the respective population mean is $$\, (1-0.9) \times (1-0.9) = 0.01 \,$$.
