#### (a) ####

Estimate of the population mean, $$\, \bar X_s = \frac 1 N \sum_{l=1}^{L} N_l \bar X_l \,$$, which as proved in the book is an unbiased estimate of population mean.

Thus $$\, \mu = \Exp(\bar X_s) = \frac 1 {100,000 + 500,000} (100,000 \Exp(\bar X_H) + 500,000 \Exp(\bar X_L)) = \frac 1 6 \Exp(\bar X_H) + \frac 5 6 \Exp(\bar X_L) \,$$.

#### (b) ####

Ignoring the finite population correction, We have $$\, \Var(\bar X_s) = \sum^{L}_{l=1} W_l^2 \frac 1 {n_l} \sigma_l^2 = \Prn{\frac 1 6}^2 \frac 1 {100} {20}^2 + \Prn{\frac 5 6}^2 \frac 1 {200} {10}^2  = \frac {1} {9} + \frac {25} {72} = 0.4583 \,$$. Thus standard error = $$\, \sqrt { 0.4583 } = 0.6770 \,$$.

#### (c) ####

If the standard error is less than the previous alllocation than the new allocation will be better. Thus, we first find standard error:

Ignoring the finite population correction, We have $$\, \Var(\bar X_s) = \sum^{L}_{l=1} W_l^2 \frac 1 {n_l} \sigma_l^2 = \Prn{\frac 1 6}^2 \frac 1 {200} {20}^2 + \Prn{\frac 5 6}^2 \frac 1 {100} {10}^2  = \frac {1} {18} + \frac {25} {36} = 0.75 \,$$. Thus standard error = $$\, \sqrt { 0.75 } = 0.866 \,$$.

The standard error for the present allocation is higher than that of the previous allocation, thus this allocation is not better than the previous allocation.

#### (d) ####

We first find the standard error for the proportional allocation:

$$\, \Var(\bar X_{SP}) = \frac 1 n \sum_{l=1}^{L} W_l \sigma_l^2 = \frac 1 {300} \Prn{\frac 1 6 {20}^2 + \frac 5 6 {10}^2 } = \frac {900} {1800} = 0.5 \,$$. Thus standard error is $$\, \sqrt{0.5} = 0.707 \,$$.

Here also standard error is more than the original allocation. Thus this allocation is also not better compared to the original allocation.
