Ignoring the finite population correction: $$ {\sigma}^2_{\bar X} = \frac { {\sigma}^2 } {n} $$.
 
Since it is a dichotomous case i.e. value of each member can either be 1 or 0 based on if this member/family is below the poverty level or not respectively, we have $$ {\sigma}^2 = p(1 - p) $$ where p denotes the fraction of population below the poverty line.

This give us:

$$ {\sigma}^2_{\bar X} = \frac { p(1-p) } {n}$$.

We know $$ p = 0.15 $$ and $$ {\sigma}^2_{\bar X} = {(0.02)}^2 $$.

This gives us $$ n = \frac { p(1-p) } { {\sigma}^2_{\bar X} } = 318.75 $$
