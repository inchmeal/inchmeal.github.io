#### (a) ####

We need $$\, \Exp(\hat \beta) = \beta \,$$. Since $$\, \hat \beta = w_1 \hat X_1 + w_2 \hat X_2 + w_3 \hat X_3 \,$$, we have $$\, \Exp(\hat \beta) = (w_1 + w_2 + w_3) \alpha + (w_1 + 2 w_2 + 3 w_3) \beta \,$$(Using $$ \Exp(\bar X_i) = \mu(t_i) = \alpha + \beta t_i $$) should be equal to $$\, \beta \,$$. Thus $$\, w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 0 \,$$ and $$\, w_1 + 2 w_2 + 3 w_3 = 1 \,$$.
