Since $$\, \mu \,$$ is a fixed number it does not make sense that $$\, P(1.44 < \mu < 1.76) = 0.95 \,$$. Just to make it clear - probability means that there is a range/set of values that a random variable can take. Here the population mean is a fixed value, thus it does not make sense to say  $$\, P(1.44 < \mu < 1.76) = 0.95 \,$$.

The confidence interval $$\, (1.44, 1.76) \,$$ means that 95% of the confidence intervals formed in this way contains $$\, \mu \,$$. Or there is a 95% chance that this interval contains $$\, \mu \,$$ but it does **not** say that the probability that $$\, \mu \,$$  takes one of the values in the interval $$\, (1.44, 1,76) \,$$ is $$\, 0.95 \,$$. The value of $$\, \mu \,$$ is fixed and it does not take any values from the interval! It's the interval that we say that the chance that this interval containing the value of $$\, \mu \,$$ is 95% because intervals are random and the interval we formed in this way have the probability for containing $$\, \mu \,$$ is 95%.

The confidence interval says about the probability of the interval not of the population mean.
