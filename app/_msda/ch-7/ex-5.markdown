I will tell me friend:

> Dude, there are many things you get right but this is not one of them. When $$ { \bar x } = 938.5 $$, it is a value which is for a particular sample of size 50. If we take another sample of size 50 - there is no guarantee that for that sample $$ \bar x $$ will remain same.
