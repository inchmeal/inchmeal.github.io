<h3> The importance of book selection </h3> 
 
My habit of spending significant time on prudent selection of books dates back to my college days. I still have vivid memories of times when I 
used to treat myself with a splurge of these books every summer.

Reading from classical texts has always been a prolific experience. They help in unequivocal grasp of the material while evading misconceptions. Their content 
 have always engrossed me in the beauty of the subject. 

(Un)Fortunately I have a few hideous experiences from books which have gone too far to make the content easy and appealing by undermining the actual 
beauty of the subject. Some times reading from these books also may lead to misapprehension and equivocal understanding.
 
Its a daunting task for authors to present difficult concepts in easy way without deteriorating the quality. While there are authors who are incredibly 
good in this art but most of them fail miserably and produce detestable results. 

Also there is another breed of frenzied authors coming up with new editions of same books every year with no significant changes in the content for 
increasing sales while deprecating the quality.
          
I have seen people(including myself) defending their misconceptions when challenged. They go through the following stages:

- defending themselves for being correct
- realisation of being incorrect
- unlearning misconceptions
- learning from right sources
   
Another thing that irates me of these texts is the contagious misconceptions it results when one move towards higher concepts based 
on his inaccurate or limited understanding from these texts.

The most abominable thing for the readers, especially incredulous, is they may continue to live in oblivion forever!

Thus the pedagogical way of giving priority to the ease of reading at the cost of compromise in quality is inexplicable and disastrous.  
 
A few of my amicable colleagues tried to convey through innuendo for me being too choosy for the books. These books are my guides, my torchbearers,
and I keep revisiting them based on my needs. Also they serve as souvenirs of the days when I first wandered in those lands.

I hope this explains why prudent selection of the books matters.

Mostly the word is used in a negative/bad context but it can be used in positive context also. Eg: If you're a rock star, you may

Incredulous is the opposite of credulous, which means "believing too easily." Both words come from the Latin word credere, which means "to believe." Incredulous 
is stronger than skeptical; if you're incredulous of something, you refuse to believe it, but if you're skeptical, you're doubtful but you haven't ruled it out completely.

Incredible describes something you can't believe because it's so right, like an incredible double rainbow. Incredulous describes how you feel when you can't believe

“a token” of an event or experience.

something of sentimental value

a reminder of past events

A song by Tears for Fears goes, “Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.” Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but

characterized by friendliness and absence of discord(disagreement).

showing a polite and friendly desire to avoid disagreement and argument.

grossly offensive to decency or morality; causing horror. eg: “a hideous pattern of injustice”

<h4 word id="engross" > Engross </h4>

devote (oneself) fully to.

consume all of one's attention or time.

Engross is a verb that means to consume all of your attention or time. Once you engross yourself in the culture of high salaries and unlimited spending accounts, it's hard to go back to cooking at a sandwich shop.

Immersing yourself fully in something can be good or bad. If you're studying Shakespeare, you want the plays to engross you so you don't lose focus. But if your video games engross you so much that you forget to shower or eat, that's a problem.

- *Usages*:

<hr/>

of or relating to pedagogy.

pedagogy means activities of educating, teaching or instructing.               

If your teacher has pedagogical dreams all night long, even in sleep, his mind is in the classroom.

If it's pedagogical, it concerns teaching, from lesson plans to approaches to teaching, even how the classroom looks — in rooms where the teacher's pedagogical 
philosophy is that students learn better when they work collaboratively, desks may be pushed together so four students can sit in their groups.

- *Usages*:
    - Mrs. Brown follows a unique style of **pedagogy**, and she often allows her students to take over the lesson.

    - There is perhaps a veiled **innuendo** in Barras' letter of December 30th.

<hr/>

<h4 word id="equivocal" > equivocal </h4>

Try to remember that uncertain means equivocal and certain means unequivocal. That's a tricky movement the un- is making, and a lot of people get stumped.

open to two or more interpretations; or of uncertain nature or significance; or (often) intended to mislead. eg: the officer's equivocal behavior increased the victim's uneasiness.

<hr/>
                
<h4 word id="unequivocally" > unequivocally </h4>

speaking unequivocally about the dangers of global warming.

<h4 word id="abominable" > Abominable </h4>

unequivocally detestable. eg: abominable treatment of prisoners.

exceptionally bad or displeasing. eg: abominable workmanship.

Abominable is as bad as it gets. 

Abominable is an adjective that should be used only when something is exceptionally bad or threatening, like a gigantic furry snowman who is terrorizing 
a village. Abominable is so absolutely awful that it causes physical revulsion. So odious that it brings even the toughest of tough guys to tears. Which 
is a bummer, because it's a surprisingly fun word to say out loud.

- *Usages*:
