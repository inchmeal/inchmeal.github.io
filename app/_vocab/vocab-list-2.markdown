<h3> Shoulders of a Giant </h3> 
 
"I am guilty!, I am guilty for instigating large scale unemployment!!!" cried Robert.
  
A vivacious and venerable man who was living an aesthetic life in the woods, yelled in the courtroom.
        
After finishing his education in robotics, he chose to live on fields for his lifelong dream to automate farming.
           
He revolutionized farming by introducing automation in many things.
              
His robots can perform many tasks like looking out for birds eating up grains, testing if grains are ripe enough, testing soil samples
and automated irrigation.
 
The use of semi-automated tractors had alleviated a lot of burden from farmers. Farmers were saying he is reminiscent of *Norman Borlaug* who 
saved billions from starving to death. Day by day, his burgeoning research is increasing the production and lowering the overall costs. This has 
garnered ecstatic reviews from all over the world. 
   
His propensity of continuous improvement mooted a move from semi-automation to total automation. After ruminating a lot on it, soon he and his team started 
working on this ambitious project diligently.

Although he kept this research secret but slowly and imperceptibly news spread and it became the talk of the town. It sent jitters and appalled many.  
The forecasts of major unemployment that this research will bring has cowered many farmers.  
 
People who were tantalized by his work took this as an opportunity to botch this research and tried to take few farmers in their influence and managed to file
a false case against him.   
 
A court letter was sent accusing him for occupying farmers land illegally. He took it as a small quibble that will sort out easily. 

Soon he understood that its no more a quibble when he was approached to sort the matter outside the court which means to stop the research immediately or 
face the consequences.

He was not a man to easily bend under duress and told them that he will stand with the truth.
 
And here he is standing tall in the court and replying to all the questions while maintaining the decorum.
 
"Evidence suggests that you had illegally setup your company on the lands of these farmers. Can you prove yourself not guilty?"
 
"Yes. My company stands there since decades and the answer lies in why objection is raised now"
 
"That does not prove anything!!"
 
"Yes, it does not and neither those fake documents that proves land belongs to the farmers.", He quipped and handed over original documents to the judge.

In the next session of the court, forensic examination of the documents turned out against him.

This broke him and he crouched in fear by these allegations. He understood that he wont be able to exculpate himself of the charges. 
 
"It is proved that you are guilty!!", Judge said.

"Yes I am. Not because of the illegal occupation of the lands."

In the quagmire of emotions, he continued... 

"I am guilty!, I am guilty for instigating large scale unemployment!!!"          

"You are not able to see the venerability of this research."                 

"It will give you time for yourself"        

"It will mitigate the problems of shortage in human labour"        

"It will make life easier"          

"Future will thank us for this research."

"It does not prove anything!!" Judge interrupted.
                                     
"Yes. It does not"
 
"Court will announce the verdict next day." Judge said. 
 
In the meantime many of his well wishers tried to convince him to make some form of appeasement with those farmers.

"Dont be so obdurate. They will destroy the company." They said.

He said he will stand with the truth.
 
He left those lands. He left all of his machinery to the farmers as a token of gift for their support for all these years.
  
They never heard any news from him. His silence made the farmers wonder if they actually won the case.

'to alleviate' is to make something easier to endure (e.g. alleviate the pain following surgery)


'to mitigate' ( Latin ='soften' ) means to lessen in force or intensity 
When someone is found guilty of a crime, there may be 'mitigating circumstances'. This means that there were circumstances surrounding the actual committing of the crime which are taken into account and so 'soften' the harshness of the penalty, reduce the sentence e.g. I kill a man. But the court is told he had just killed my chld. As far as the law is concerned, I had no right to take the law into my own hands and retaliate. I am guilty of homicide. But as opposed to being a cold-blooded murderer, the intensity of anger towards the man for what he had done is a mitigating factor when deciding the punishment to be handed out by the court.
