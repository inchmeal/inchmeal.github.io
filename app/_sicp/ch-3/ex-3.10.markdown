As we can see in the drawn picture, like in the book's version of `make-withdraw`, this also creates two separate environments for W1 and W2. Thus changes in W1 are not reflected in W2 and vice versa.

The difference between the book's version and this version is that now there are two extra environments created(E1, E3).
