Too lazy to draw :)

We can see by looking at the procedure that space complexity is $$ \theta (n) $$ as the deepest path of the tree can have at max $$ n $$ nodes.
 
I am not able to solve for time complexity. Although we can easily see that time complexity will always be less than $$ 2^n $$ as
 each step is divides into two branches and the maximum depth of the tree will be $$ n $$.
 
Please help, if you have solution for it.
