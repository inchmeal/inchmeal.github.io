<h3> Experience with RandomX </h3> 

To work in RandomX is a luminous career for anyone. After perennial trials, I finally managed to get an offer from them. After the offer I had a meeting
with my manager in RandomX. 
Initially in the meeting, manager appeared very frank and gregarious. I felt that manager will condone my frowning on the number of working hours.
But this contention because of working hours caused the company to rescind the job offer.
I was not able to exculpate myself from the accusations of the manager. 

The manager turned out to be the most obdurate person I have met in my life. I refrained myself from spewing invective to this manager and RandomX for 
having such hires. This entire episode left an antipathy for RandomX in my heart.

On knowing all this, one of my friend studying disease pathology, told me that it could me a pathological problem with the manager to not accept any disagreement.
On listening to my friend, I realised that may be if I worked with the manager, my job might have turned into a bondage.
 
I seldom liked fawning over the boss. Thus this rescinding of the offer actually turned out to be a good thing. After realising all this, I moved
on with alacrity.
