All of my friends earning humongous packages. Why not me?                   

Every one is measuring the diameter of the world. Why can't I?            

Every Tom, Dick and Harry is launching a startup. Why not me?<br/>

Have these questions and here comes the splurge of advices from all over the internet:
   
- There are people who are in even worst conditions than you.
- You should compete with yourself.      
- Life is not a race.             
- Choose your own destiny.          
   
Yeah, the advices seems to be correct. 

I should not feel bad,
   
- While they can overspend on daily grocery and me being constantly trying to minimise the budget.
- When they purchase high end gadgets and me not being able to get my mobile repaired.
- When they are on a spree of buying flats and myself not being able to afford rent.
   
Yeah. I should not worry because I can also look down and see the people left behind:
 
- who were still not able to find jobs.
- for whom *career choice* is a luxury and they can do any damn job.
- who prefer walking instead of taking a bus to save 2 cents.       

Perhaps everyone has someone to look up and someone to look down. 
 
Is it cogent to get *content* and evade enviousness by looking down? 

How about someone looking down on me and being okay when they cant afford a luxury vacation because there are people like me who cant even afford the rent.

Or lets say I am diagnosed with *cancer* and someone looks down on me to feel content that its okay to not have money atleast they are not dying with cancer.

Or someone looking down on civilians in Iraq or Syria and getting content for atleast not being in that situation.

Yeah I see. There is a problem with approach of looking down. I can't jot it down in words.

"Compete with yourself" is apparently a more convincing advice.

- Last year I use to earn 1000 bucks a month and now I earn 1100 bucks a month.
- Last year I read only one book and this year I read two. 
- Earlier I can't write a single sentence, now I am writing complete articles.
  
I should not worry, even:
  
- if someone got a 50% raise.
- Even when there are people reading one book a weak.
- Even though I still make 100s of grammar mistakes and can't articulate properly.

Oh I see, there is a problem with this advice too. 

"Life is not a race". It is quite convincing.

It helps in a great way to focus on my own goals. With razor sharp focus, I worked hard for my goal to invent .  

No more I have any distractions. One day another


But it hardly helps me to get over my feelings of jealousy.
 
Okay lets see for other advices. "Choose your own destiny".
 
But how?
 
"Do what interests you more".
 
I dont know what are my interests.
 
"Keep looking. Until you find any."
 
I am looking for them for half of my life. Interests come and go.
 
Ah! I see. This advice is also not taking me anywhere.
