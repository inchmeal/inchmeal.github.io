Confused with their career plans, Ram and Shyam, asked for guidance from their respective fathers. 

Both fathers helped in their own ways.

<h3>Ram's father:</h3>

> Ram, I will tell you a story:
> 
> There was a boy who loved programming. He was always improving himself by learning new paradigms, languages or any upcoming technologies. He was a 
> perfectionist when it came to programming. He was so passionate about it that he could hardly appreciate anything else. He used to wonder how 
> people can enjoy literature, history, or sports.
>
> Creating Graphical User Interfaces(GUI) was something he hated. He always used to depend on others for GUI tasks. Inspite of GUI being a field of programming 
> whenever he tried it, he found it boring and monotonous. He thought may be GUI is not for him.
>
> One day he was on his own to complete a GUI task as nobody was around. His perfectionist attitude in programming motivated him to complete the task in best
> possible way. After some initial hassles, he realised GUI is not that bad. As he went deeper he found how interesting it can get.
>
> This made him to start falling in love with GUIs.
>
> Similarly one day he was amazed when he learned that how foundations of many concepts in programming are based on mathematics. Improper teaching 
> during his school days had demotivated him from enjoying mathematics. But this time out of amazement he started learning it. 
> 
> And again he started falling for something other than programming.
>
> As he grew older he discovered other subjects like history, which he was not able to appreciate earlier, also became interesting. History made him realised how many 
> present world problems are the same old problems from ages. History helped him in understanding the meaning of: "Standing on the shoulders of giants".  
> 
> Now he enjoys everything he does. Because he always found himself working on things he loves.

After giving some thought Ram understood what his father *meant*. He thanked his father and left.

Ram was happy that he is able to figure out the message by himself.

<h3>Shyam's father</h3>

> Shyam, Everyone should follow a career path that makes them happy. Either you do what you love. Or you love what you do. Thus in either case
> you will be working on something you love or you will eventually fall in love.
> 
> Once you start doing what you love, you will enjoy whatever you are doing and that will help to keep you motivated. Doing what you love is an 
> obvious choice that one should go for. 
> 
> Sometimes believing in following your love may result in limiting you. One may start believing that he may not be able to do anything else outside his favourite area.
> 
> But as you go deeper with your favourite area you will realise how it connects to many other areas. Then you will start appreciating that other areas are also
> equally interesting. You just need to dig a little deeper. Everything offers a initial friction and once you are deep enough in it you will start enjoying it. 
>
> Thus you can build your career in any area you choose. What matters is you put enough effort in it to overcome the initial friction. 
> 
> Doing what you love or loving what you do, both will make you happy.

Shyam understood what his father *told*. He thanked him and left.

Shyam was happy that he understood the message.
