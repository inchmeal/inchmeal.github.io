*Soon I will get rid of most of the problems.       
Soon I will have an enchanting life.      
Soon there will be charm mornings and peaceful nights.     
Soon there will be happiness and tranquility.*      


*They say life will be boring when there is nothing to worry.      
This is plain optimism.      
When curiosity is there, who needs problems for enchantment?*      


*So should I keep hoping and waiting for a life without worries?*      


*The only perennial thing from past are these problems.       
If one gets resolved then other, even more daunting, may come in.    
There can always be a worst situation then the present one.    
No upper limits.*        


*If future can be predicted from past then life without worries is only a dream.     
This is the best guess that can be made about the future.*      


*Hope is good but wait is not.    
I should be living in each moment.    
This might be the easiest of time that may ever come.     
Everythingâ€™s never gonna be alright.*
