It has been long since functional programming is on my bucket list. 

Finally I am moving forward on this quest. 

<!--more-->
As from numerous online [posts][debasish] and [reviews][norvig], it is no doubt that working through *[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, SICP][sicp]* is a great start.

Initially I thought of implementing SICP solutions with Haskell or Scala, but I changed my plan as it may create much more hurdles and probably 
results in dropping the plan entirely.

I will be using the current popular scheme family of language, [DrRacket][racket]. There is a [sicp package][sicp_package] in DrRacket
that gives the same version of scheme used in book.

I have already skimmed through a book, [Realm of Racket][racket_book] for getting myself familiar with the language.

All of my solutions can be viewed using the right/top menu on this page. 

Only one thing is guaranteed about these solutions - they will contain mistakes. 

Kindly leave your feedback for any issues found. I will do my best to fix them.

Lets begin this fascinating journey...
