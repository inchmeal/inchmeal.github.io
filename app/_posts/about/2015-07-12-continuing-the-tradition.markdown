After procrastinating for so long, I am finally here to start blogging. I shall be using this space for learning and sharing ideas on programming, machine-learning and mathematics. Occasionally I will be sharing my views on life, philosophy or anything that interests me.

I believe in self education as the best form of learning.

> Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.

Hoping to keep myself motivated on the path of continuous learning by sharing my experiences here.

<em>Hello World!!</em>
