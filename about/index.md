I enjoy doing the following:

* Coding
* Learning things
* Thinking
* Cooking occasionally.
* Movies

Recently I am interested in learning Mathematics and AI.

I found myself continously updating/changing my views about things.

I have relatively strong opinions and I believe in them unless proven otherwise.

I always seek for perfection in most of the things I do. It sometimes helps and sometimes it creates problems for not moving ahead.
