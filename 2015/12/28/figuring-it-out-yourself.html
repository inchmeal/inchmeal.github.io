			<p>Confused with their career plans, Ram and Shyam, asked for guidance from their respective fathers.</p>

<p>Both fathers helped in their own ways.
<!--more--></p>

<hr />

<h3>Ram's father:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ram, I will tell you a story:</p>

  <p>There was a boy who loved programming. He was always improving himself by learning new paradigms, languages or any upcoming technologies. He was a 
perfectionist when it came to programming. He was so passionate about it that he could hardly appreciate anything else. He used to wonder how 
people can enjoy literature, history, or sports.</p>

  <p>Creating Graphical User Interfaces(GUI) was something he hated. He always used to depend on others for GUI tasks. Inspite of GUI being a field of programming 
whenever he tried it, he found it boring and monotonous. He thought may be GUI is not for him.</p>

  <p>One day he was on his own to complete a GUI task as nobody was around. His perfectionist attitude in programming motivated him to complete the task in best
possible way. After some initial hassles, he realised GUI is not that bad. As he went deeper he found how interesting it can get.</p>

  <p>This made him to start falling in love with GUIs.</p>

  <p>Similarly one day he was amazed when he learned that how foundations of many concepts in programming are based on mathematics. Improper teaching 
during his school days had demotivated him from enjoying mathematics. But this time out of amazement he started learning it.</p>

  <p>And again he started falling for something other than programming.</p>

  <p>As he grew older he discovered other subjects like history, which he was not able to appreciate earlier, also became interesting. History made him realised how many 
present world problems are the same old problems from ages. History helped him in understanding the meaning of: “Standing on the shoulders of giants”.</p>

  <p>Now he enjoys everything he does. Because he always found himself working on things he loves.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>After giving some thought Ram understood what his father <em>meant</em>. He thanked his father and left.</p>

<p>Ram was happy that he is able to figure out the message by himself.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Shyam's father</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shyam, Everyone should follow a career path that makes them happy. Either you do what you love. Or you love what you do. Thus in either case
you will be working on something you love or you will eventually fall in love.</p>

  <p>Once you start doing what you love, you will enjoy whatever you are doing and that will help to keep you motivated. Doing what you love is an 
obvious choice that one should go for.</p>

  <p>Sometimes believing in following your love may result in limiting you. One may start believing that he may not be able to do anything else outside his favourite area.</p>

  <p>But as you go deeper with your favourite area you will realise how it connects to many other areas. Then you will start appreciating that other areas are also
equally interesting. You just need to dig a little deeper. Everything offers a initial friction and once you are deep enough in it you will start enjoying it.</p>

  <p>Thus you can build your career in any area you choose. What matters is you put enough effort in it to overcome the initial friction.</p>

  <p>Doing what you love or loving what you do, both will make you happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Shyam understood what his father <em>told</em>. He thanked him and left.</p>

<p>Shyam was happy that he understood the message.</p>

<p><br />
So, which <em>way</em> do you prefer? Ram’s Father or Shyam’s Father…</p>
